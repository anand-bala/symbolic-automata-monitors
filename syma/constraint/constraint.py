        Generate out of self.formula a new representation of the Boolean constraint in terms of a tuple
        (alphabet, s_, s__) as follows:

        alphabet => a dictionary mapping the Boolean variables occurring in the DNF Boolean formula to integer indices.
            The length of alphabet will give the number of Boolean variables n.

        s_ => a list of lists, i.e. s_ = [C1, C2, ..., Cm] where Ci represents the i-th (conjunction) clause of the
            DNF formula. Each Ci is a list containing the indices of the variables occurring in the literals of the i-th
            clause.
        s__ => a list of lists of 0's and 1's, analogue to s_, which is used together with s_ to build the
            literals of the DNF formula. 1 is used to indicate that the corresponding variable in s_ is negated,
            whereas 0 is used for positive literals.
        The length of s__ (as well as of s_) will give the number m of 'and' clauses occurring in the DNF formula.

        If an assignment to the Boolean variables of the DNF formula F is encoded into a bit vector bv of length n,
        where n is the number of Boolean variables occurring in F, then the above data representation allows to easily
        evaluate the Boolean constraint and any of its clauses individually.
        Example: Consider the DNF formula F = (a AND (NOT b) AND c) OR ((NOT a) AND c) OR (b AND c). Then:
                 alphabet =  {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}
                 s_  = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 2], [1, 2]]
                 s__ = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 0]]
            For the assignment {a=True, b=False, c=False}, then bv = [1, 0, 0] with 1 meaning True and 0 False.
            The evaluation of F is computed as
                max(min(abs(bv[s_[0]]-s__[0])), min(abs(bv[s_[1]]-s__[1])), min(abs(bv[s_[2]]-s__[2])))
            or alternatively
                max(min((bv[s_[0]]+s__[0]) mod 2), min((bv[s_[1]]+s__[1]) mod 2), min((bv[s_[2]]+s__[2]) mod 2))
            which yields
                max(min(1,1,0), min(0,0), min (0,0)) = 0 = False

        NOTE: We assume that self.formula is a Boolean DNF formula by construction.

        """
        The volume of a Boolean constraint F with n Boolean variables is defined as the ratio #models/2^n, where
        #models is the number of models satisfying the Boolean formula F, i.e. the number of different assignments to
        the n Boolean variables which yield F true. Note that 2^n represents the total number of possible assignments.

        Computing #models is intractable in practice, thus we will strive for an approximate value of #models.
        We assume the Boolean constraint F is in disjunctive normal form (DNF), i.e. F = C_1 v C_2 v ... v C_m, and
        implement the KLM self-adjusting coverage algorithm to compute an approximate value of #models in
        O(n * m * log(1/delta) / epsilon^2) time, where n denotes the number of variables and m the number of clauses
        appearing in F (s. https://www.math.cmu.edu/users/af1p/Teaching/MCC17/Papers/KLM.pdf, page 437).

        NOTE: the algorithm does not work if an 'and' clause is not satisfiable, e.g. if a clause C_i contains the
              positive and the negative literals of the same variable at the same time
              (i.e. C_i = ... and v_k and ... and not v_k ...). However, duplicated literals do not cause any problem.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        epsilon: float \in (0, 1)
            Specification of the allowed error.
        delta: float \in (0, 1)
            Specification of the desired probabilistic guarantee.

        Return:
        ------
        The method applies first the KLM algorithm (s. above) to compute an approximation Y of the exact number of
        models #F of the Boolean constraint F s.t.
            Pr[(1 − epsilon) * #F ≤ Y ≤ (1 + epsilon) * #F] ≥ 1 − delta
