# Symbolic Automata Monitors

This package provides a library for creating and manipulating symbolic automata
monitors. Initially forked from code by [Dejan
Nickovic](https://sites.google.com/view/nickovic/), and a lot of bells and whistles were
added my me.

## Alpha Status

This is purely a package that I use in my research, and haven't really documented a lot
of things, nor does this have a lot of testing. Things mostly work, but open a issue if
you do find something or send a pull request to fix it.
